## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

In the following SOP, please use the exact names of equipment as noted in the table above.

Provide a step-by-step description of the protocol. The identification of difficult steps in the protocol and the provision of recommendations for the execution of those steps are encouraged.

### Sampling seawater samples

Please specify how you collected samples and note what equipment you used to do so (e.g. targeted water mass, volume, sampling equipment, replication).

To collect water samples, use 1,5l commercial drinkingwater bottles and clean pre-filters.

1. For each location where watersamples are collected, 5 replicates are taken with the Niskin carrousel on a Research Vessel at 1 meter above the sea surface. The Niskin carrousel is soaked for 3 minutes on the          water surface before going down. The seawater samples are taken at one meter above the sea surface. It's important that the Niskin carrousel doesn't touch the seafloor! When collecting the water sample, use a clean pre-filter. Collect 5 replicates of 1l.
2. Open the tap of the Niskin bottles and  

Each day two field negative samples will be collected to check for possible contaminations on board of the Research Vessel. At 5 locations 1 Niskin bottle will be rinsed with drinkingwater, afterwards the bottom of the Niskin bottle will be closed and second bottle with drinkingwater is emptied inside the Niskin bottle. Then the Niskin bottle will be close than the negative control sample is collected through the tap into a 1,5L waterbottle..  Each day we will also open one waterbottle in the morning and leave it open on deck near the fishing nets. In the evening the bottle we be closed and filtered. Each day we will also collect filter negative samples: 1L drinkingwater is filtered. Ideally these negative control samples do not contain eDNA. 
### Preparation

Please specify the preparatory actions you took before you collected the samples and note what equipment was needed to do so (e.g. disinfection of work surfaces, preparations to the equipment you intend to use later on).

### Before filtering the water

1. If the watersamples are frozen, get them out of the freezer the evening before you will filter them and store them at roomtemperature in the dark.
2. Preprint your labels that you will stick on the Sterivex filter with the unique filtercode.
3. If there's no freezer available to store the Sterivex filters after filtering the seawater sample, you need to prepare Longmire Storage Buffer in a laminar flow cabinet with the following constitution: 100 mM Tris, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaCl. For 1 Sterivex filter, 2 ml Longmire Storage Buffer is used.
4. Wear new clean gloves and change gloves in case they get dirty.
5. Fill 1 Nalgene bottle with 10 % Bleach solution.
6. Benchspace sterilization: Clean the benchspace with 10% bleach, whipe down with a paper towl, then clean the surface with 70% Ethanol and whipe down.
7. Masterflex tubing sterilization: Install the Masterflex tubings on to the two pumpheads. Attach 2 Masterflex Adaptor Fitting at the left sides of the tubings. Immerse the left endings of the Masterflex tubing into the Nalgene bottle with 10% bleach solution. Immerse the right endings of the Masterflex tubing into the empty Nalgene bottle. Make sure the Masterflex pump pumps from left to the right. Switch on the Masterflex pump (stand 4) and pump 100 ml through the tubing. Get the two endings with the Masterflex Adaptor Fitting out of the bleach and pump until the tubing doesn't contain any bleach anymore. Close the Nalgene bottles. Place the left endings of the Masterfles tubes into 2 commercial drinking water bottles. Pump 100 ml drinking water from the left to the right direction. Empty the tubings and make sure you dont touch the left part of the Masterflex tubes before filtering.
8. It's very important that the bottles with your seawater sample are mixed well by inverting them several times before you start filtering. 

### Filtration

1. Invert the seawater bottle several times before you start filtering.
2. Please specify how you filtered the samples and note what equipment you used to do so in the eDNA filtering sheet (e.g. mixing, volume filtered, size of filter and pores, filtration apparatus, duration of filtration, replication).
3. Take out a Sterivex filter from it's package and attach the outlet of the Sterivex filter to the Masterflex Fitting Adaptor. Don't touch the Sterivex with your hands because the Stevivex filter goes into the seawater sample. This to avoid contamination.
4. Place the inlet of the Sterivex Filter in the seawater sample and  filter 1 L of seawater. Note down the filtered volume. If the Sterivex filter is clogged before 1 L is filtered, you need to filter more water by using a second Sterivex filter until you filtered 1 L volume. Make sure the STerivex fitler is completely dry!
5. Write down the exact volume of the filtered seawater, use a measuring cup for this. Throw away the seawater.
6. Label the Sterivex filter with a preprinted sticker.
7. Close the Sterivex with 2 Combi-Cap Syringe Caps.

### Storage and sample preservation

1. If the Sterivex filters can be stored in the freezer, place the Stevivex filters in a good labeled Ziplock bags in the freezer until further processing.
2. If there's no freezer available, 2 ml of Longmire's Storage Buffer needs to be added with to the Sterivex filter. This is done by pipetting 2 ml Longmire's Storage Buffer on the Sterivex filter by using P200. Open the inlet cap of the Sterivex, pipet 2 ml Longmire Storage Buffer on the filter and close with the Combi-Cap Syringe Cap. Place the Sterivex filters in a Ziplock bag and keep at roomtemperature in the dark until further processing.
