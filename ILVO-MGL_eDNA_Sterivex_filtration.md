## BACKGROUND

This document describes the required protocol to conduct [insert name of the method/protocol].

### Summary

Insert a short description of the background for the method/protocol (e.g. why and for which purpose do you perform water sampling).
Please provide a brief summary of your method including, as appropriate, a brief description of what techniques your best practice is about, which ocean environments or regions it targets, the primary sensors covered, what type of data/measurements/observing platform it covers, limits to its applicability.

### Method Description and Rationale

Insert a short description of the functioning principal of the methodology used in the protocol (i.e. how does the method work?). Please note that this is different from the step-by-step description of the protocol procedure.
Insert a short statement explaining why the specific methodology used in the protocol has been selected (e.g. it is highly reproducible, highly accurate, procedures are easy to execute etc….).

### Spatial Coverage and Environment(s) of Relevance

If applicable, please specify the region where the protocol is applied. For regional term guidance see the [GAZ ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/gaz). If applicable, please indicate here the environment(s) of relevance for the protocol, e.g. Abyssal plain. Select from the [ENVO ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/envo).

## PERSONNEL REQUIRED

## EQUIPMENT

- Description: E.g., "filter".
- Product Name and Model: Provide the official name of the product.
- Manufacturer: Provide the name of the manufacturer of the product.
- Quantity: Provide quantities necessary for one application of the standard operating procedure (e.g., number of filters).
- Remark: For example, some of the consumable may need to be sterilized, some commercial solution may need to be diluted or shielded from light during the operating procedure.

## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

In the following SOP, please use the exact names of equipment as noted in the table above.

Provide a step-by-step description of the protocol. The identification of difficult steps in the protocol and the provision of recommendations for the execution of those steps are encouraged.

### Preparation

Please specify the preparatory actions you took before you collected the samples and note what equipment was needed to do so (e.g. disinfection of work surfaces, preparations to the equipment you intend to use later on).

Glove Sterilization: Sterile nitrile gloves must be worn at all times during the sterilization, sampling, filtering, preservation and storage steps. Gloves directly from the box are not considered sterile. To sterilize, put on a new pair of gloves, squirt 10% bleach solution from a wash bottle onto the gloves and rub hands together, then squirt with EtOH to get rid of bleach residue.  

Benchspace sterilization: Clean the benchspace with 10% bleach, whipe down with a paper towl, then clean the surface with 70% Ethanol and whipe down.
